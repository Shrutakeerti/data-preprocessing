numpy is a powerful, open-source library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Some basic numpy commands include:

np.array(): creating a numpy array from a python list
np.arange(): generating a numpy array of evenly spaced values within a specified range
np.zeros(): creating a numpy array of all zeros
np.ones(): creating a numpy array of all ones
np.linspace(): generating a numpy array of evenly spaced values within a specified interval
np.reshape(): reshaping a numpy array into a different
