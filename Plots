A line plot, also known as a line chart,
displays data as a series of data points connected by straight lines. 
Line plots display trends,
such as stock market fluctuations or temperature changes over time, 
they compare datasets with a continuous independent variable like age or time.
Line plots illustrate cause and effect relationships, such as sales revenue changes based on marketing budget. 
They also visualize continuous data, like height measurements over time. 
Line plots can be misleading if the scales on the axes are not carefully chosen to reflect the data accurately.

A bar plot, also known as a bar chart,
displays data using rectangular bars,
where the height or length of the bars represents the magnitude of the data.
The bars can be oriented either vertically or horizontally.
A vertically oriented bar chart is often referred to as a vertical bar chart or a column chart.
If you're looking for an effective way to compare data,
bar plots are ideal for comparing different categories or groups. 
They excel with discrete data, like comparing sales revenue by product.
They show how different categories contribute to the whole and rankings, such as sales percentage or budget allocation.
Bar plots can visualize data that you can easily rank,
like displaying the bestselling books in the market. Their simplicity and interpretability, make them favored for data visualization.
